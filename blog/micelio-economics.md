I've been thinking a lot about economics lately. Not macroeconomics per se, but the economics of software. The artificial limits, the churn, the upgrades, the subscriptions. The things that keep you paying and keep you engaged.

LLMs have the power to workaround all of that. I can't stop thinking about it.

## The TODO Example

Let me use TODO applications as an example, but not to suggest that replicating one is trivial or that building one proves something about your engineering skills. That's missing the point.

A TODO app represents everything we've normalized in software. Subscription fees. Vendor lock-in. Data stored somewhere you don't control. The promise of synchronization that never quite works. The slow accumulation of features you never asked for.

Now imagine building that same functionality without any of that. Just markdown files in an environment you control. Git for synchronization. No subscriptions. No vendor lock-in. Your data, your rules.

This isn't about how easy it is to replicate a TODO app. It's about demonstrating that the economics we've accepted, the monthly fees, the SaaS model, the enterprise agreements, are choices, not necessities. They are design decisions that could be made differently.

And when you make them differently, you end up with something smaller, simpler, more resilient, and potentially more impactful than the complex alternatives.

## The Liability Myth

Here's where I expect pushback: "Companies need vendors who can be held liable when things go wrong. That's why enterprises pay for SaaS instead of rolling their own."

There's truth to this. Enterprises do want someone to blame. They want contracts, SLAs, and legal recourse. But let's be honest about what this actually means in practice.

When a VC-backed SaaS company fails, what happens to their enterprise customers? The company gets acqui-hired, the product gets sunset, and the customer is left migrating to a competitor anyway. The liability was always somewhat illusory.

More importantly, the infrastructure layer is commoditizing rapidly. Cloud providers offer managed databases, authentication, storage, and compute that handle most of the genuinely complex operational concerns. The "liability" that enterprises pay for is increasingly not about technical reliability but about having someone to call when they're confused.

That's valuable, but it's not as valuable as companies charge for it. And as LLMs get better at explaining, troubleshooting, and configuring, even that support value erodes.

## What Might Companies Be Worth?

This leads to an uncomfortable question: what are many software companies actually worth?

If an LLM can replicate the core functionality, if the switching costs are dropping, if the infrastructure is commoditizing, and if the support value is diminishing, what's left?

Some companies have genuine moats. Network effects. Proprietary data. Deep domain expertise. Regulatory compliance that's genuinely hard to achieve. These companies will continue to thrive.

But a significant portion of the VC-backed software landscape is building in the shrinking space between "technically possible" and "practically accessible." As that space contracts, their addressable market contracts with it. Some of these companies, valued at tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, may ultimately be worth something closer to zero.

That's not a comfortable thing to say, but I think it's true.

## Micelio as an Alternative Model

This is the context in which I've been building Micelio.

Micelio is not a company I'm trying to build. It's not a product I'm trying to sell. It's a proof of concept that shows you don't need to design things to be expensive.

When you design for enterprise sales, you design for enterprise needs. When you design for venture capital returns, you design for growth at all costs. When you design for acquisition, you design for defensibility.

But what if you design for nothing? What if you just build what you think is useful, make it open source, and let people use it if they want?

That's Micelio. Tiny. Open source. Agent-first. No sales team. No pricing page. No enterprise tier. Just a different way of thinking about how software gets built.

Maybe that has more impact than another company with another pricing page and another enterprise agreement. Maybe small and open beats big and closed.

## A Personal Note

I'm in a privileged position. I'm the CEO of Tuist, which means this can be my guinea pig. I don't have to think about money. I have a job that I like, and an appetite for trying new things outside of work. It's just me.

I like tinkering with things. I like tinkering with new versions of how things can be. And Micelio is a lot of fun.

This is not Tuist. It's not a new company. It's not a pivot. It's not me signaling that I'm looking for something else. Micelio is what I do in my free time because I like building things, and because I believe the future of software development looks very different from its present.

If anyone from Tuist is reading this: don't worry. I'm not going anywhere. This is exploration, not abandonment. It's curiosity, not restlessness. It's me being me.

## What's Next

If you're curious about what I'm building, you can find Micelio at micelio.dev. No pressure to use it, no sales pitch, just an experiment in progress.

The future of software economics is still being written. I'm just trying to contribute a paragraph or two.
