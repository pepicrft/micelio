# Design System Research

## Overview
Use this skill to infuse Micelio UI with battle-tested design system patterns drawn from Shopify Polaris, Stripe UI, and GitHub Primer. It centers on three pillars: tokens, components, and layouts. The references distill what these systems do well so we can reuse their strengths without copying their brand.

## Quick start
1) Load `references/patterns.md` for distilled guidance on tokens, components, and layouts with examples from Polaris/Stripe/Primer.
2) Pin down constraints: product surface (dashboard, settings, onboarding), density, and theme direction (e.g., nature palette already in tokens).
3) Apply tokens first (semantic palette, spacing, motion), then compose components (buttons, inputs, nav, cards), then arrange layouts (app shell, list/detail, tables, forms, marketing blocks).
4) Cross-check with the checklists in the references before finalizing.
