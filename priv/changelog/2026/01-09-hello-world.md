This is the first changelog entry for Micelio.

If you're new here, start with the blog post ["A Vision for Agent-First Development"](/blog/hello-world).

In the short term we'll keep this changelog focused on:

- User-visible changes to Micelio
- New mic integration capabilities
- Fixes that affect workflows or stability
