# Hello, World!

Welcome to the Micelio blog! This is our first post announcing the launch of Micelio - a minimal, agent-first forge designed for the future of software development.

## What is Micelio?

Micelio is not just another Git forge. It's built from the ground up for an agent-first world where:

- **AI agents and humans collaborate** on massive codebases
- **Sessions capture goal, reasoning, and changes** together
- **The server is the source of truth**, not local disk
- **Infinite scale** is the target - billions of files, hundreds of thousands of landings per day

## Inspired by the Best

We take inspiration from industry leaders who've solved scale:

- **Google Piper**: Billion-file monorepos
- **Meta Sapling**: Massive concurrent development
- **Turbopuffer**: Object storage-first architecture
- **WarpStream**: Stateless, auto-scaling compute

## The Vision

We're building for a future where:

1. **Hundreds of AI agents** work concurrently on the same codebase
2. **Humans review**, not write most code
3. **Object storage** provides infinite capacity at minimal cost
4. **Coordinator-free landing** eliminates bottlenecks

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for:

- Technical deep-dives into our architecture
- Progress updates on agent-native features
- Insights from building for unprecedented scale
- Tips for human-AI collaboration workflows

Welcome to the future of code collaboration. Welcome to Micelio!
