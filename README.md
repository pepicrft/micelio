# Micelio

Micelio is a minimalist, free software git forge built for the agentic era. It replaces human-centric primitives like issues, branches, and pull requests with concepts native to human-agent collaboration: structured tasks, iterative attempts, automated validations, and explicit delegation. Early and experimental.

## Development

> [!NOTE]
> Micelio uses [libgit2](https://libgit2.org/) for Git operations via Zig NIFs. You'll need to install it before compiling:
> - **macOS**: `brew install libgit2`
> - **Debian/Ubuntu**: `apt-get install libgit2-dev`

To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
