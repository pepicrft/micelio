# Memory & Continuity

## Project State

Key places to check for project state:

- `docs/contributors/next.md` - Upcoming features and roadmap
- `docs/contributors/design.md` - Architecture decisions
- Recent git commits: `git log --oneline -20`

## Session Notes

If you need to pass context to a future session, document it in the PR description or commit messages.
