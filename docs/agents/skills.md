# Skills & Abilities

## Static Assets

When making changes to CLI commands or agent capabilities, update the corresponding static files:

- **SKILL.md** (`priv/static/SKILL.md`) - Documentation for the mic CLI served at `/SKILL.md`
- **skill.md** (`priv/static/skill.md`) - Agent guide served at `/skill.md`, keep aligned with `AGENTS.md`

## Sync Requirements

When you update `AGENTS.md`, also update `priv/static/skill.md` so `/skill.md` stays in sync.
