- Does SourceHut have issues?
- How does the mailing list work in SourceHut
- We need to implement authentication
- Decide how storage can be scaled horizontally (e.g. can we use Ceph in Elixir).
  - What about SQLite vs Postgres vs MySQL
- Can we include the marketing pages here and remove them at compile-time?
  - Or maybe have something like GitHub pages, and make those pages a github-pages kind of site that's deployed to Micelio?
- I think we should have a zig CLI as part of this repo that can serve as an interface to the repository
- Support OAuth2 dynamic registration such that MCP clients can interface with it.
- Set up OpenAPISpex
