              <strong>Welcome to Micelio!</strong>
              Micelio is the open source, agent-first git forge
              the future has been waiting for.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both the forge and CLI are fully open source. Micelio is to mic what GitHub is to git.
            </p>

            <p class="home-feature-description">
              Sessions capture goal, reasoning, and changes together. Built for hundreds
              of AI agents working concurrently, with stateless compute that auto-scales
              based on demand.

            <h3 class="home-feature-title">Checks</h3>
            <p class="home-feature-description">
              Nix-native checks run locally with the exact derivations that power remote execution.
              Content-addressed caches keep results consistent and fast, so a green check locally is the
              same check everywhere—no centralized queue required.

            <p class="home-feature-description">
              Designed for a future where humans review, not write most code.
              Conversation, decisions, and changes are unified in one workflow.

              Targets Google/Meta scale: 1B+ files, 500k+ landings per day,
              100k+ concurrent sessions. Object storage-first architecture
